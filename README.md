# Hello!

This framework's main application and demo is through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but being a framework, it can also be applied elsewhere.

LDP is an attempt to redefine one's relationship with work by reducing [[Friction]], eventually creating velocity towards their declared life's purpose ([[Ikigai]]).

LDP takes inspiration from many places, pulling the best ideas and mashing them together. Concepts are sourced from, but not limited to:
- [[Ikigai]]
- [[Getting Things Done]]
- [[Pillars, Pipelines, Vaults (PPV)]]
- [[Agile Project Management]] and it's derivatives ([[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]], [[Kanban (Agile)|Kanban]])

This note serves to explain the fundamental theory of LDP. 

## Preface
### Who is this for?
LDP is a life-management framework for those who find themselves distracted by the modern world. LDP will create meaning (Life), direction (Disciplines), and action (Projects). If you are missing either of these, you may find LDP useful.

Fully utilizing LDP requires a moderate amount of setup (mainly self-reflection). You can post-pone this step if you need something working now.
